The Problem with generating images from big databases through FastAPI

FastAPI is a highly regarded and efficient tool, but like any framework,
it has its own set of challenges depending on how it's used.
The issue you're experiencing might stem from how you're trying to integrate CPU-intensive tasks
(like image generation) into a framework that excels at handling I/O-bound asynchronous tasks (like serving APIs).

Here’s a breakdown of why this could be happening:

1. Synchronous Blocking Code:
FastAPI is designed to handle asynchronous tasks very efficiently, but plotting libraries like Matplotlib
and Seaborn are synchronous by nature. This means that whenever you run these functions
(which perform blocking I/O operations, such as rendering the plot), it can block the entire FastAPI server,
causing it to become unresponsive or crash. FastAPI, being an asynchronous framework,
excels with non-blocking I/O operations but doesn’t handle blocking operations
like plt.show() or plt.savefig() well in a real-time server context.

2. Concurrency and Resource Management:
FastAPI uses asynchronous processing for handling multiple requests concurrently.
When an operation is blocking (like generating a plot), it takes up the resources
that FastAPI could use to serve other requests, leading to performance issues.
When you run a heavy synchronous function like generating graphs inside FastAPI,
it can stall the server, causing timeouts or crashes.

3. Serving Large Files:
Matplotlib and other plotting libraries create images in memory. When FastAPI tries to serve these images,
it may run into memory consumption issues, especially when trying to handle multiple requests at once.
This is particularly relevant for large image files or complex plots.

4. Flask vs. FastAPI:
Flask is traditionally used in more synchronous applications, so blocking operations like generating images
don't cause as much trouble because they block the thread for a single request only. FastAPI,
on the other hand, is optimized for handling many asynchronous requests concurrently, and blocking operations
can disrupt its event loop.

Solutions to Integrate Plotting in FastAPI:
Offload Plotting to a Background Task: You can use FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks to offload the plotting
task to a background process, so the server isn’t blocked while the plot is being generated.
This way, FastAPI can continue handling other requests while the plotting happens in the background.


from fastapi import BackgroundTasks
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas

def generate_plot(file_path: str):
    fig = visualization.plot_delays_by_airline()  # your plotting function
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
    canvas.print_png(buf)
    buf.seek(0)
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(buf.read())

@app.get("/show_hourly_bar_graph")
def show_hourly_bar_graph(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    file_path = "static/graphs/hourly_bar_graph.png"
    background_tasks.add_task(generate_plot, file_path)
    return {"message": "Graph generation is in progress"}

Generate Images Beforehand: Another option is to pre-generate your plots and save them to a static directory.
Then, just serve them as static files via FastAPI. This would avoid generating the plots on every request
and significantly reduce load.

Use a Separate Thread or Process: You could run the plotting code in a separate thread or process,
isolating it from the main FastAPI server thread. This will allow FastAPI to continue serving requests
without waiting for the plotting task to finish. You can use Python's concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
or multiprocessing to handle this.

Optimize Plotting Code: If you’re only generating a simple plot, consider using lighter, more efficient
libraries like Plotly or Bokeh, which offer interactive plots and better performance for web applications.

Stream Images Instead of Saving to Disk: Instead of saving the image to a file and then returning it,
you can stream the image directly from memory. This can improve performance and remove the need for disk I/O.


from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

@app.get("/show_hourly_bar_graph")
def show_hourly_bar_graph():
    file_path = "static/graphs/hourly_bar_graph.png"
    fig = visualization.plot_delays_by_hour()  # your plotting function
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
    canvas.print_png(buf)
    buf.seek(0)
    return StreamingResponse(buf, media_type="image/png")

Why FastAPI is Still a Great Tool:
Despite these challenges, FastAPI’s asynchronous nature is its strength, particularly for handling a large number
of concurrent I/O requests. For use cases that involve API calls, database interactions, and streaming data,
FastAPI outperforms Flask and many other frameworks. However, for CPU-intensive tasks like image generation,
it's not optimized out of the box, and you’ll need to make adjustments to ensure smooth performance.

If your app relies heavily on generating plots or handling complex image processing in real-time,
you might consider moving that part of the workload to a dedicated task queue (e.g., Celery),
or use background processing frameworks that can handle these types of workloads separately.
